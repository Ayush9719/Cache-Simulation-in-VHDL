# Cache-Simulation-in-VHDL
### This consists of a simulation of direct mapping in cache using VHDL
I have created a cache simulation using the VHDL and simulated the concept of direct Mapping and the Write-through policy using the created cache. ModelSim Simulator was used to simulate the VHDL code. Each block of cache consists of 8-bit word.
